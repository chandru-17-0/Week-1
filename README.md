# EV Smart Value Predictor — Machine Learning Based Insight Tool

**Intern:** A H M Chandrashekhara  
**Institution:** SKSVMA College of Engineering and Technology  
**Week:** 1 — Edunet / AICTE Internship  
**Date:** 02-11-2025

## Project Summary
This project predicts Electric Vehicle (EV) prices using supervised regression and introduces a derived metric — **Value Efficiency Score** — which estimates "value for money" based on range, price, and motor power.

## Files
- `EV_SmartValue_Predictor.ipynb` — Jupyter Notebook code  
- `EV_SmartValue_Predictor_Report.docx` — Formal report  
- `EV_SmartValue_Predictor_Presentation.pptx` — Presentation  
- `A_H_M_Chandrashekhara_Week1_SmartValuePredictor.pdf` — Combined submission file  

## Unique Features
- Computes **Value Efficiency Score** = `(Range / Price) * Motor_power`  
- Ranks top 10 EVs by efficiency  
- Uses both Linear Regression and Random Forest models  
- Creates correlation heatmap and feature importance plots
